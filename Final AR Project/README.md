This is the directory that will hold the final product.

Currently, everyones code is on separate applications and all held in their separate branches. However, towards the end of this week, we will work on integrating all the pages together into one application. This will be relatively simple since it is easy to add pages to existing applications. Once that merging is done, the app will be contained in this directory.
